the orders of the features for this crf c r f the largest number n is the markov order of the crf c r f states are n tuples of output labels each of the other numbers k in orders represents a weight set shared by all destination states whose last most recent k labels agree if orders is an order 0 crf c r f is built defaults if non it must be the same length as orders with positions indicating that the weight set for the corresponding order contains only the weight for a default feature otherwise the weight set has weights for all features built from input predicates start the label that represents the context of the start of a sequence it may be also used for sequence labels if no label of this name one will be added connection wills be added between the start label and all other labels even if fullyconnected fully connected is this argument may be in which case no special start state is added forbidden if non specifies what pairs of successive labels are not allowed both for
