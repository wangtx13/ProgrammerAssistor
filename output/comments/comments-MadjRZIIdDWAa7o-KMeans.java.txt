stop after movement of means is less than this maximum number of iterations minimum fraction of points that move initialize clustermeans cluster means for each instance measure its distance to the current cluster means and subsequently assign it to the closest cluster by adding it to an corresponding instance list the mean of each cluster instancelist instance list is then updated add to closest cluster label it such < note this trickiness bad style? maybe it just means now that we've deleted the entry we have to repeat the index to get the next entry get the instance the furthest from any centroid and make it a new centroid dont't create new empty clusters can't find an instance to move instancelist instance list has no remove and instances aren't parsed out by most pipes so we have to pre process here and possibly leave some instances without cluster assignments add next center that has the max m a x of the min m i n of the distances from each of the previous j 1 centers idea from andrew moore tutorial not sure who came up with it originally
