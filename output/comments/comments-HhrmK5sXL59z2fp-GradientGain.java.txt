gradientgain gradient gain of a feature f is defined in terms of maxent max ent type feature+class feature s f f = f c graidentgain graident gain of a feature f is g f = g f c = abs e~ f e f where e~ is the empirical distribution according to the label distribution and e is the distribution from the imperfect classifier gradientgain gradient gain of a feature f is g f = sum_c g f c feature location value feature location index populate targetfeaturecount target feature count et al the below relies on labelweights label weights summing to 1 over all labels! serialization
