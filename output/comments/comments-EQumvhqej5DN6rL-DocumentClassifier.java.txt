create for each of the arguments create the pipeline that will take as input {data = target = for classname} and turn them into {data = featurevector feature vector target = label} target > label data > containing contents remove usenet use net or email header data > tokensequence token sequence tokensequence token sequence words lowercased remove stopwords from sequence replace each token with a feature index collapse word order into a feature vector create an empty list of the training instances add all the files in the directories to the list of instances the instance that goes into the beginning of the instancepipe instance pipe will have a in the data slot and a from args in the target slot make a test/train split ilists 0 will be for training ilists 1 will be for testing create a classifier trainer and use it to create a classifier
