construct the set b a list of instances of size numinstances num instances * numclasses num classes 1 each instance in this list will have weights mislabel distribution associated with classes the intance doesn't belong to set the initial weights to be uniform boosting iterations sample instances from set b using the weight vector to train the weak learner calculate the pseudo loss of weak learner stop boosting when pseudo loss is 0 ignoring weak classifier trained this round if we are in the first round have to use the weak classifier in any case update and normalize weights an of ints of the same size as data where the the samples are randomly chosen from data using the distribution of the weights vector make sure rounding didn't mess things up do sampling
