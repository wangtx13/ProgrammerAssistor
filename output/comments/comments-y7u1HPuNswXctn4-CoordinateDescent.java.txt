keep the unthresholded values of each parameter here we're not concerned with the precision variable data size is sum of squared values for the default feature don't use soft threshold for intercept update scaledresiduals scaled residuals for remaining instances loop through once to get the value we are changing update the residual for the intercept update the residual for all other non zero features
