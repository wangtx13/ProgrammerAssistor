xxx we need to implement this in featurevector feature vector subclasses share index2location trick ala indexedsparsevector indexed sparse vector that change values out hashedsparsevector hashed sparse vector setindex2location set index2 location indices length= +indices length+ maxindex= +indices indices length 1 index2location setdefaultvalue set default value 1 i dislike this name but it's consistent with densevector dense vector cas this vector is binary location = index2location get index if location >= 0 	ret += values location * v valueatlocation value at location i location = index2location get index if location >= 0 			values location += v valueatlocation value at location i * factor serialization history 0 == wrote out index2location probably a bad idea gobble up index2location
