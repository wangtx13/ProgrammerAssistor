generated name /* the matrixn constructor will clone the arrays */ this is so it will be useful as a general dereferencing utility for multidimensional arrays /* this could be extended to work for all matrixes */ from matrix access by index into sparse efficient for sparse and dense matrices a singleindex single index sucks but so does the visitor pattern not often used serialization garbage
