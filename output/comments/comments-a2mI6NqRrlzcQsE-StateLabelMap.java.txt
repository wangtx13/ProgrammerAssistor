mapping labels to integers mapping state names to integers if a standard fst f s t is used using one of the provided in crf c r f in this case the state and label alphabets are the same key index identifying a state value index identifying a label that the state maps to in the state machine key index identifying a label value indices of states that are associated with the label use the same alphabet for state and label since no values are allowed in our map directly use the get get the label index add the state and get its index add the indices to the label state and state label maps it is possible that a label is never seen in the training data in that case the number of labels will not be equal to the size of the label target alphabet until the state with the unseen label is added to the label alphabet while constructing the fst f s t add such a label here
