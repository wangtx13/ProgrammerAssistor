xxx perhaps this should just use an alphabet and not implement set clique constructor for delegation of abstractset set to verts /* can't delegate to thashmap t hash map because in early versions of trove that we are frozen at 
 * the thashmap t hash map hashcode hash isn't consistent with equals this is workaround which may
 * be removed when we upgrade trove */ cannot just do variable vertslist verts list toarray to because that would cause a classcastexception cast i suppose that's why toarray to is overloaded for delegation of abstractcollection collection to verts using vertslist verts list here assures that toarray to always the same ordering using vertslist verts list here assures that toarray to always the same ordering for delegation of hashset hash set to verts the total size of a dense discrete variable over this clique iterating over assignments serialization garbage clique
