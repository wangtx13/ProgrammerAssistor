first we find the union of all the indices used in the instances dense dense vectors were present sparse vectors were present and they had greater indices than the dense vectors therefore we create sparse vectors and add all the dense indices sparse indices may have been present but we don't care since they never had indices that exceeded those of the dense vectors reaching this statement implies we can create a sparse vector create the mean vector with the indices having all zeros nothing copied sorted and no checks for duplicates gdruck@cs umass edu it is faster to sort indices first gdruck@cs umass edu it is faster to sort indices first above var = x^2 n*mu^2 / n 1
