line searches and backtracking p385 numeric recipes in c termination conditions either a abs delta x/x < rel_tolx for all coordinates b abs delta x < abs_tolx for all coordinates c sufficient function increase uses alf a l f tolerance on absolute value difference initialstep initial step is ignored this is b/c if the initial step is not 1 0 it sometimes confuses the backtracking for reasons i don't understand that is the jump gets larger l a r g e r on iteration 1 fraction of step size alam if found a good step 0 0 if could not step in direction gradient find maximum lambda converge when delta x / x < rel_tolx for all coordinates the largest step size that triggers this threshold is precomputed and saved in alamin look for step size in direction given by line x = oldparameters old + alam*line initially alam = 1 0 i e take full newton step step check for convergence convergence on delta x 				if alam < alamin { sufficient function increase wolf condition if value is infinite i e we've jumped to unstable territory then scale down jump convergence on delta x backtrack first time through lambda <= 5 lambda_1 lambda >= 1*lambda_1						 iff we've converged based on absolute x difference
