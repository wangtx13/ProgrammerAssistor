process the command line options break data into tokens break the data into an on whitespace and then convert that to a feature vector using user specified names break the data into an on whitespace and then convert that to a feature vector convert the target to a numeric value which should be an for poisson regression create an iterator that will create an instance from each line in a by breaking the line into name n a m e label l a b e l feature=value feature=value construct a new instance list passing it the pipe we want to use to process instances now process each instance provided by the iterator
