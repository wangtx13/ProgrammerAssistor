xxx we need to implement this in featurevector feature vector subclasses share the index2location this will be unsafe if indexedsparsevectors indexed sparse vectors are ever allowed to be modifiable but i don't think that this will be the case that change values out indexedsparsevector indexed sparse vector setindex2location set index2 location indices length= +indices length+ maxindex= +indices indices length 1 i dislike this name but it's consistent with densevector dense vector cas this vector is binary the other vector is binary no test for indices == for this is not allowed in an indexedsparsevector indexed sparse vector serialization index2location is considered transient to save disk space
