only used for storable fixme f i x m e this is wrong copy correct from diamondfigure diamond figure growy = getstroketotalwidth get stroke total width * sqrt2 s q r t2 growx = growy = getstroketotalwidth get stroke total width / 2d * sqrt2 s q r t2 center point if overlapping just the opposite corners calculate angle to determine quadrant dermine line points this will be get the intersection with edges no proper edge found we should send one of four corners
