process the command line options print some helpful messages for cases read the instancelist instance list are we also splitting the instances? current doesn't want to do this so i'm not changing it but i don't know a reason dm d m check which type of data element the instances contain for feature sequences it's necessary to create a new instance list in order to make sure that the data alphabet is correct iterate over the instances in the old list adding up occurrences of features next iterate over the same list again adding each instance to the new list after pruning make the new list the official list for featurevector feature vector so it can be freed by the garbage collector so it can be freed by the garbage collector convert featurevector's feature vector's to featuresequence's feature sequence's by simply randomizing the order of all the word occurrences including repetitions due to values larger than 1 so it can be freed by the garbage collector convert featurevector's feature vector's to featuresequence's feature sequence's by simply randomizing the order of all the word occurrences including repetitions due to values larger than 1 so it can be freed by the garbage collector split into three lists and write them out
