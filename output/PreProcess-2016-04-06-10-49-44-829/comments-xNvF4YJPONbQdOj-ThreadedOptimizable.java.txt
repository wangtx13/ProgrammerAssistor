determine when value/gradient become stale tasks to be executed in individual threads each task is instantiated only once but executed in every iteration thread pool to compute value/gradient for one batch of data milliseconds set up fix submitted by mark dredze mdredze@cs jhu edu compute values again run all threads and wait for them to finish compute log probability compute values again if required compute gradients again run all threads and wait for them to finish number of instances per batch batch assignments get the indices of batch
