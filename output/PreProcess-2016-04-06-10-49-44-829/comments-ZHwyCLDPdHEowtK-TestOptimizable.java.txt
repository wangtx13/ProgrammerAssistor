set all the to unique values using setparameters set test to make sure those are there the gradient from the optimizable function the gradient calculate from the slope of the value this setting of epsilon should make the individual elements of the analytical gradient and the empirical gradient equal this simplifies the comparison of the individual dimensions of the gradient and thus makes debugging easier this was epsilon * 5 logger fine print the gradient from the maximizable function the gradient calculate from the slope of the value this setting of epsilon should make the individual elements of the analytical gradient and the empirical gradient equal this simplifies the comparison of the individual dimensions of the gradient and thus makes debugging easier cas however avoid huge epsilon if norm of analytic gradient is close to 0 next line used to be norm = math max 0 1 matrixops matrix ops twonorm two norm analyticgradient analytic gradient but if all the components of the analyticalgradient analytical gradient are very small the squaring in the twonorm two norm causes epsilon to be too large akm a k m check each direction perturb it measure new value and make sure it agrees with the gradient from maxable getvaluegradient get value gradient 			{ i = 0 uncomment this line to debug one parameter at a time cas logger fine print no negative below because the gradient points in the direction of maximizing the function normalize the matrices to have the same l2 length /*
