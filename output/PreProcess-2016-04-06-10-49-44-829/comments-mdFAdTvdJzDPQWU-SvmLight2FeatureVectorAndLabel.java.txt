there is no guarantee that the feature indices in the text will be the same as in the pipe the data should be exactly the same however just permuted we expect the data for each instance to be a line from the svmlight s v m light format text ignore comments at the end in svmlight s v m light +1 and 1 are the same label adding a special case to normalize the rest are feature value pairs index may be 1 if growth of the data alphabet is stopped
