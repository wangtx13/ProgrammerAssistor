this quantity is used in entropy calculation how many words should we report? some topics may have fewer than the default number of words with non zero weight this is an of hash sets containing the words of interest for each topic used for checking if the word at some position is one of those words the same as the topic top words but with indices instead of strings used for iterating over positions this is an of hash sets that will hold the words of interest present in a document which will be cleared after every document the count of each topic again cleared after every document diagonals are total number of documents with word w in topic t out alphabet lookupobject lookup type + + count + * + numtokens num tokens + / + wordtypecounts word type counts type + * + tokenspertopic tokens per topic topic + = + coefficient * count / wordtypecounts word type counts type get the mean length some topics may not have all n words now calculate the standard deviation finally produce an overall topic score how many words should we report? some topics may have fewer than the default number of words with non zero weight
