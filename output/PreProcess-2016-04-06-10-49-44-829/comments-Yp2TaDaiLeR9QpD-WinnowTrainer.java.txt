xxx attend to featureselection!!! feature selection!!! if train is run more than once we will be reinitializing the weights todo t o d o provide to save weights init weights to 1 out init weights to 1 theta= +theta loop through all instances sum up xi*wi for each out feature index +fi out in instance + ii make guess for each label using threshold update weights according to alpha and beta upon incorrect guess guess 1 correct is 0 guess 0 correct is 1 			system 			 out results guessed 		for x=0 x<numlabels x<num labels x++ 		 out results x 			system 			 out correct label +correctindex +correct index 			system 			 out weights are 			for h=0 h<numlabels h<num labels h++ { 				for g=0 g<numfeats g<num feats g++ 			 out weights h g 				system 				 out 			} learner predicted 0 correct is 1 > promotion learner predicted 1 correct is 0 > demotion
