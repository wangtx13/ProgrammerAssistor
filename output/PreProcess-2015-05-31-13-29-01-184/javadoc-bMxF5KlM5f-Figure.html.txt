graphics2d graphics2 d to draw to gets the layer of the figure the layer is used to determine the z ordering of a figure inside of a drawing figures with a higher layer number are drawn after figures with a lower number the z order of figures within the same layer is determined by the sequence the figures were added to a drawing figures added later to a drawn after figures which have been added before if a figure changes its layer it must fire a figurelistener figure listener figurechanged figure changed event to its figure listeners fixme f i x m e replace value by a layer a figure is only

bounds of the figure and of its decorator figure this is used by tool's which create a new figure and by tool's which connect a figure to another figure this is a basic operation which does not fire

bounds are used by some handle for adjusting the figure the drawing bounding box of the figure and of its decorator figure this takes line width line caps and other decorations into account note getdrawbounds get draw bounds must include the logical bounds of the figure the preferred size is used by layouter to determine the preferred size of a figure for most figure's this is the same as the dimensions by getbounds get bounds gets data which can be used to restore the shape of the figure after a basictransform basic transform has been applied to it see also basictransform basic transform affinetransform affine transform restores the shape of the figure to a previously stored state transforms the shape of the figure transformations using precision arithmethics are inherently lossy operations therefore it is recommended to use getrestoredata get restore data restoreto restore to to provide lossless undo/redo functionality after the transform has finished the bounds of the decorator figure are changed to match the transformed bounds of the figure this is a basic operation which does not fire events tx the transformation sets an attribute of the figure attributekey

unmodifiable map is if the user can manipulate this figure if this operation tool's should not interact with this figure checks if a point is contained by the figure this is used for hit testing by tool's creates handles used to manipulate the figure detaillevel detail level the detail level of the handles usually this is 0 for bounding box handles and 1 for point handles a collection of handles see also handle a cursor for the specified location a collection of action's for the specified location the collection may contain entries these entries are used interpreted as separators in the popup menu actions can use the property figure action_submenu to specify a submenu a specialized tool for the specified location if no specialized tool is available a tooltip for the specified location checks if this figure can be connected gets a connector for this figure at the given location a figure can have different connectors at different locations p the location of the connector prototype the prototype used to create a connection or if unknown this allows for specific connectors for different connection figures gets a compatible connector if the provided connector is part of this figure the connector if the provided connector is part of another figure a connector with the same semantics for this figure if no compatible connector is available sets whether the connectors should be visible for the specified courting connector connectors can be optionally visible if this figure draws its connectors checks whether the given figure is contained in this figure a figure includes itself the figure that contains the given point a decompositon of a figure into its parts a figure is considered as a part of itself a clone of the figure after cloning a collection of figures the connectionfigures connection figures contained in this collection still connect to the original figures instead of to the clones using this operation and providing a map which maps from the original collection of figures to the new collection connections can be remapped to the new figures informs a figure that it has been added to the specified drawing the figure must inform all figurelisteners
