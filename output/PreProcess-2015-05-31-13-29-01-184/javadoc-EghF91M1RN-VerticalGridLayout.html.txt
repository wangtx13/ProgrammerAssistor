row creates a grid layout with the specified number of rows and columns all components in the layout are given equal size one but not both of rows and cols can be zero which means that any number of

specified number of rows and columns all components in the layout are given equal size in addition the horizontal and vertical gaps are set to the specified values horizontal gaps are placed at the left and right edges and between each of the columns vertical gaps are placed at the top and bottom edges and between each of the rows one but not both of rows and cols can be zero which means that

manager determines the size of individual components by dividing the free space in the container into equal sized portions according to the number of rows and columns in the layout the container's free space equals the container's size minus any insets and any specified horizontal or vertical gap all components in a grid layout are given the same size specified by layoutcontainer layout
