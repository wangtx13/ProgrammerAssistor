allocate the to store the initializers description of the the other dimensions default to zero and are assigned when the values are set evaluate the initializers determine if any conversion is necessary on the initializers quick test to see if conversions apply if the dimensionality of the is 1 then the elements of the initializer can be primitives or boxable types if it is greater then the values must be types and there are currently no conversions that we do on those if we have conversions on those in the future then we need to get the real base type here instead of the dimensionless one we do a bsh cast here strictjava strict should be able to affect the cast there when we tighten control unwrap any primitive map voids to etc store the value in the i think this can happen
