fields for the control flow graph analysis algorithm used to compute the maximum stack size a control flow graph contains one node per basic block and one edge per jump from one basic block to another each node i e each basic block is represented by the label that corresponds to the first instruction of this basic block each node also stores the list of it successors in the graph as a linked list of edge constructor to compute offsets and to manage forward references changes the opcode of the jump instruction in order to be able to find it later see resizeinstructions resize instructions in codewriter writer these temporary opcodes are similar to jump instruction opcodes except that the 2 bytes offset is unsigned and can therefore represent values from 0 to 65535 which is sufficient since the size of a is limited to 65535 bytes changes ifeq i f e q jsr j s r to opcodes 202 to 217 inclusive changes ifnull i f n u l l and ifnonnull i f n o n n u l l to opcodes 218 and 219 inclusive
